## Debugging with Console
  
  
Crevice4 supports `--verbose` option which means output detail informations to console: see [Command line interface](#command-line-interface ) for the details.
  
When crevice4 starts with `--verbose` option, invocation of functions like `Console.WriteLine()` in the user script will be activated and the messages will be printed to console.
  
```bat
> crevice4.exe --verbose
```

## Edit user script with Visual Studio Code
  
  
Simple text editors can do this, but IDE which supports IntelliSense is very helpful. Cevice4 provides IDE integrate feature. 
  
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ ) and [C\# Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp ) are required.
